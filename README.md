    "Create a Jupyter Notebook using IBM Watson Studio. You can choose any language you want (Python, R, or Scala). You will need to include a combination of markdown and code cells.

    "* Cell 2 (rendered as Markdown): Your name, in bold characters. In the line below your name, write your current or desired occupation in regular font.\n",
    "* Cell 3 (rendered as Markdown): In italic formatting, write one or two sentences about why you are interested in data science. For example, you can start your first sentence with \"I am interested in data science because ...\".\n",
    "* Cell 4 (rendered as Markdown): In H3 header styling, explain in a short sentence what your code is supposed to do in Cell 5.\n",
    "* Cell 5 (code cell): Your code, as described in Cell 4. It must be executed and must display an output. Try to keep the code simple (it can even be \"1 + 1\").\n",
